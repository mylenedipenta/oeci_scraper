# Oregon eCourt Case Information (OECI) Scraper

The Oregon Judicial Department maintains a website called Oregon Judicial Case Information Network (OJCIN) for all 36 circuit courts, the tax court, and the appellate court. The site contains the department's Register of Actions and judgment records. They are filed in 2 databases: 
* Appellate Case Management System (ACMS) and 
* Oregon eCourt Case Information Network (OECI).

This scraper crawls the OECI section of the OJCIN website and retrieves information into JSON files.
